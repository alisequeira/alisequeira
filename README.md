### what's up! ðŸ‘‹
### I'm from Nicaragua. Land of lakes and volcanoes :volcano:
### I am a software developer currently working as associate software engineer at SolidLogix LLC
### :computer: | :movie_camera: | :art: | :guitar:
### Besides software development my biggest passion it's watching movies, my favorite one: "PULP FICTION"
### Since my childhood I was interested in computers, I didn't have a clue about development since a was younger thanks to my cousin that this wonderful world caught my attention. I like the fact to be able to build every idea in my mind. And work with wonderful people that share their knowledge. With this profile, I'm trying to show my journey as a learning developer through every single project that I go through. If you wanna help me on this path you can text me out whenever you want.
